# Emir's Assembly Reference (EAR)

This repository has all the assembly files along with a little cheatsheet I have done to practice for university.

All the NASM files are named and numbered. The numbers are given with an arbitrary order of difficulty, so it is advised to read and understand the NASM files in order, but as with anything, nothing is mandatory and you can do it however you like.

This repository was made with x86_64 (So 64bit Intel/AMD processors) NASM on Ubuntu Linux. Register names as well as system calls change depending on your CPU architecture and operating system, so if you are running these codes on another configuration, you may need to do some light research to find your equivalent of stuff used here.

If you are not on a 64-bit x86 Linux system, these documents will not even try to provide any support for you. Please understand that I am just doing this in my free time, so I don't have enough time to provide for every configuration. Though as a little info, if you are on Windows 10/11 (x86 64-bit for obvious reasons), you can install and use WSL, which will provide you with a Linux environment on top of your Windows install (That is what I am using right now!). This should make it easier for you to follow the reference codes since the system calls will be the same. **That is all the help you will get for me for Windows.**

This repository also will not provide any information on basic stuff like using a terminal, running programs on the terminal or installing programs like the NASM compiler.

If you are a beginner, VSCode with the *x86 and x86_64 Assembly* extension by *13xforever* will cover all your needs in a simple manner. If you are experienced enough (or if you want to try new things and are experienced enough) then you can also try Vim or Emacs, although any text editor even including the default text editor in your operating system will work with varying degrees of comfort.

Refer to Cheatsheet.md for all the little tidbits. 

Refer to LICENSE.md for all the information on sharing, citing, publicising and forking this repository.

Finally, have a nice day, keep on coding!
